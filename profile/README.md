Hey there! We are a team building projects on the [Stellar Network](https://stellar.org/). Our bigger interest currently lies in Soroban smart contracts, you can take a look at the learning material and example smart contracts in the [soroban-guide repo](https://github.com/xycloo/soroban-guide). If you also want to dig a bit inside Futurenet from your browser or simply want to see some soroban XDR decoding in Rust, you can take a look at the [soroban-explorer repo](https://github.com/xycloo/soroban-explorer).

We also are working on [`soroban-analyzer`](https://github.com/xycloo/soroban-analyzer), which is a CLI tool to detect gas inefficiencies in Soroban rust code. Currently it doesn't perform many checks and there may be false positives, but you can try it out already!

Besides smart contracts, we also have interest in bringing [sTeX](https://stex.xycloo.com/) to life. It's a cloud LaTeX editor that relies on our decentralized marketplace to publish, and sell documents. sTeX is currently in the candidates for the Stellar Community Fund edition #11, [this is our submission](https://communityfund.stellar.org/projects/stex).

Another interesting project we have worked on, is [Tmyxer](https://github.com/xycloo/tmyxer). It's a proof-of-concept XLM mixer that operates within the network and relies on the groth16 algorithm, which we have implemented in Rust targeting a WASM build [here](https://github.com/xycloo/wasm-groth16-verifier) (thanks to `ark-std, ark-bls12_377, ark-ec, ark-ff` from [arkworks](http://arkworks.rs)!). However, given what has happened with TornadoCash, the mixer is designed to not be used in a production environment, in fact it only allows deposits of 100XLM and uses a very primitive hashing lookup (discussed [here](https://github.com/xycloo/tmyxer#specification)) that by default supports only up to 100 deposits. 

You can also start joining [our discord server](https://discord.com/invite/w7fBhSS34Q), which we will start using actively once we have deployed our first production projects.
